Possum Attributes Dataset Analysis with Model Training

The target of this report is to conduct the analysis of a dataset of values in an Possum Attributes Dataset, including finding relationships between predictors(inputs). The process of optimally altering/transforming the dataset, training a model, and evaluating its performance when using the test data of the dataset. Our overall goal with this will be to accurately predict the chances of a possum being a male or female with regards to the values of the predictors of that instance, and figure out which model would be the most accurate in this prediction. As well as displaying other correlations between variables. Our goal at the end of this project is that hopefully we can accurately predict based on the stats of an instance of a possum if it is a female or a male

Models that may be used: Neural Network model, Decision Tree Model, and Logistic Regression.
