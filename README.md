CP322 Machine Learning final project 

Baseball Attributes Dataset Analysis with Model Training

This projects target is to conduct the analysis of a dataset of statistics in a Baseball Pitch by Pitch Dataset, we will be finding correlations/relationships between predictors.  training a model using the dataset's data points, modifying and transforming the dataset in the best way possible, and then assessing the model's performance. Our overall objective is to determine which model is the most accurate in this prediction and to accurately predict the type of pitch, given the values of the relevant predictors in that instance. Also graphically showing additional correlations between variables. Ideally, after finishing this project, we will be able to identify the type of pitch based on its various statistics.

Models that may be used: Neural Network model, Decision Tree Model, and RandomForestClassifier.
