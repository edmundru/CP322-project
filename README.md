CP322 Machine Learning final project 

NBA Dataset Analysis with Model Training

The target of this report is to conduct the analysis of a dataset of values in an NBA dataset listing various stats, including finding relationships between predictors(inputs). The process of optimally altering/transforming the dataset, training a model, and evaluating its performance when using the test data of the dataset. Our overall goal with this will be to accurately predict the chances of a specific game being a win(1) or loss(0) with regards to the values of the predictors of that instance, and figure out which model would be the most accurate in this prediction. As well as displaying other correlations between variables. Our goal at the end of this project is that hopefully we can accurately predict based on the stats of an instance of a specific NBA game which team won and which team lost

Models that may be used: Neural Network model, Decision Tree Model, and Logistic Regression.
