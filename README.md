Possum Attributes Dataset Analysis with Model Training

This projects target is to conduct the analysis of a dataset of values in an Possum Attributes Dataset, we will be finding correlations/relationships between predictors.  training a model using the dataset's data points, modifying and transforming the dataset in the best way possible, and then assessing the model's performance. Our overall objective is to determine which model is the most accurate in this prediction and to accurately predict the likelihood that a possum will be male or female given the values of the relevant predictors in that instance. Also graphically showing additional correlations between variables. Ideally, after finishing this project, we will be able to identify whether a possum is a female or a male based just on its statistics.

Models that may be used: Neural Network model, Decision Tree Model, and Logistic Regression.
